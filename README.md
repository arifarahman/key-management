# Hellow,I am Nawrose Meseid.I have completed an online course from udemy by 52 euro(5000 tk) and done my university project as a part of my thesis.I implemented a theory to increase fault tolerance and the Elastic Data Center Company processed my given data and show me this output as a part of my online course.So here i attached the file.

its not easy to change the fault tolerance of existing stream processing engine .Because the fault tolerance mechanism is fixed value for the SPE.So the istructor suggest me to think about to generate new SPE by combining both SPARK And KAFKA SPE to get the mixup result.This can be decleared as a new SPE.But we have to mind it that -A SPE cant be create with only one quality or without other quality.So to declare this as a new SPE we have to work with other quality like message semantics,latency,Scope,Window mapping etc.
